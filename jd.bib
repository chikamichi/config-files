  abstract = {{The Sun has an obvious effect on climate since its radiation is the
	main energy source for the outer envelopes of our planet. Nevertheless,
	there is a long-standing controversy on whether solar variability
	can significantly generate climate change, and how this might occur.
	This is a crucial issue not only in the field of paleoclimatology,
	but also for predicting the future of the Earth's climate, which
	will be subject to perturbations by anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
	Indeed, if climate changes due to the Sun were large and rapid, this
	would make it more difficult to extract the anthropogenic effects
	from precise records of instrumental data over the past century.
	Hence, Sun-climate relationships have never been so controversial
	as today, forming a debate that often escapes the scientific arena.
	Here, we provide a review of this problem by considering changes
	on different time scales, from the last million years up to recent
	decades. In doing so, we also critically assess recent claims that
	the variability of the Sun has had a significant impact on global
	climate. The different studied records also illustrate the mulfi-disciplinary
	nature of this difficult problem, requiring knowledge in several
	fields such as astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric dynamics and
	microphysics, isotope geochemistry and geochronology, as well as
	geophysics, paleoceanography and glaciology. Overall, the role of
	solar activity in climate changes - such as the Quaternary glaciations
	or the present global warming - remains unproven and most probably
	represents a second-order effect. Although we still require even
	more and better data, the weight of evidence suggests that solar
	changes have contributed to small climate oscillations occurring
	on time scales of a few centuries, similar in type to the fluctuations
	classically described for the last millennium: The so-called Medieval
	Warm Period (900-1400 A.D.) followed on by the Little Ice Age (1500-1800
	A.D.). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	All these anomalies, observed in the total electron content (TEC)
	measured by GPS or altimeters, show geographical heterogeneity in
	the perturbed TEC amplitude and suggest a dependence on geomagnetic
	latitude. This latitudinal dependence has been taken into account
	in the previous 3-D modelling used for the interpretation of the

	What emphasize the role of geomagnetic field within the neutral-plasma

	database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from
	satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including
	the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent
	scatter radar covering 1981-1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number

	noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data,

  abstract = {{{[} 1] A gravity wave anelastic dispersion relation is derived that
	includes molecular viscosity and thermal diffusivity to explore the
	damping of high-frequency gravity waves in the thermosphere. The
	time dependence of the wave amplitudes and general ray trace equations
	are also derived. In the special case that the thermal structure
	is isothermal and the Prandtl number (Pr) equals 1, exact linear
	solutions are obtained. For high-frequency gravity waves with w(Ir)/N
	<< 1 an upward propagating gravity wave dissipates at an altitude
	given by similar or equal to z(1) + H ln(omega(Ir)/2H\textbackslash{}m\textbackslash{}(3)nu(1)),
	where H is the density scale height, N is the buoyancy frequency,
	nu(1) is the viscosity at z = z(1), and omega(Ir) and m are the gravity
	wave intrinsic frequency and vertical wave number, respectively.
	Thus high-frequency gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths
	dissipate at the highest altitudes, resulting in momentum and energy
	inputs extending to very high altitudes. We find that the vertical
	wavelength of a gravity wave with an initially large vertical wavelength
	decreases significantly by the time it dissipates just below where
	it begins to reflect. The effect of diffusion on a gravity wave is
	similar to the effect of shear in the sense that as the molecular
	viscosity and thermal diffusivity increase due to decreasing background
	density, the intrinsic frequency plus m nu/H decreases and the vertical
	wave number increases in order to satisfy the dispersion relation
	for Pr = 1. We also briefly explore the results with different Prandtl
	numbers using numerical ray tracing. Gravity waves in a Pr = 0.7
	environment dissipate just a few kilometers below those in a Pr =
	1 environment when H = 7 km, showing the utility of the analytic,

  abstract = {{Internal gravity wave perturbation Velocity subject to constant dynamic
	viscosity and constant kinematic viscosity are approximately derived
	based on an energy conservation principle. When the dynamic viscosity
	is assumed to be a constant, the velocity at any height relative
	to the velocity at the saturation height, Z(sat), is found to be
	solely dependent on the number of scale heights measured from Z(sat).
	Gravity wave energy dissipation due to constant dynamic viscosity
	primarily occurs from one scale height below to one scale height
	above the saturation height. When the kinematic viscosity is assumed
	to be a constant, the perturbation amplitude either increases or
	decreases monotonically with height depending on whether the energy
	dissipation rate due, to viscosity, can offset the effect of the
	decreasing atmospheric density with increasing height. The derivations
	are made simple by assuming that the non-dissipative dispersion relation
	is applicable to the dissipative situation. The condition for the
	assumption to be approximately valid is also given.}},
